/*************** Algorithm ******************

1. Page will first run the loadData function, which will immediately load the text into the "select"
2. Next the user will select, or not select, an item from the drop down list other than the first option, and will then hit the click button
3. After that, the start function runs, which is relatively simple: its only job is to set the value of the "text" or "fact" column to the fact which corresponds 
with the element selected from "group"
4. In order to find out which option was selected from "group," we will use the "getIndex" function
5. After the getIndex function finds which element was selected in group, we will pass that number of the element back to start() using return, 
and it would return in a line which would look something like this: document.getElementById("funFact").value = facts[getIndex;];
