<p> Though most know him as a successful rapper, Drake's life wasn't always full of fame.
What most don't know is that Drake built his status from the bottom. In his album "Nothing Was the Same" released in
2013, he revealed this about him in a song called "Started From the Bottom." The song hints to the fact that 
he worked hard to get where he is currently. He didn't have a perfect childhood; he dealt with various problems at home,
in addition to racial discrimination at school. 

<p> However, as a celebrity, Drake hasn't allowed fame to change him. He remembers where he came from. Drake 
makes an effort to use his power and status for good. In  2018, Drake released a music video for his song called "God's Plan."
The music video really adds to the lyrical meaning of the song. He portrays himself in the video as a "God" not by exploiting people, but rather
by giving to people, and being caring to others. Not to mention, Drake also donates to various charities, and those in need. 
Drake's kind heart and caring personality are what make him my hero.
